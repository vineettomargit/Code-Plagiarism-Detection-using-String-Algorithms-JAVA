Order Matching Engine Like Stock Exchange 

-  Architected and developed a high-performance order matching engine in Java using Spring Boot and Gradle, enabling fast, concurrent processing of buy/sell orders for multiple stock symbols.  
-  Designed thread-safe order book data structures with priority queues and atomic operations to achieve microsecond-level matching latency in multi-threaded environments.  
-  Integrated persistent storage with JPA/Hibernate and MySQL, supporting JSON metadata and flexible user portfolio management; configured for H2 in-memory DB during development.  
-  Implemented comprehensive lifecycle management for orders and trades, including limit, market, and stop-loss order types, with real-time market depth and trade execution reporting.  
-  Created demonstration and interactive CLI modules showcasing order submission, cancellation, market simulation, and performance testing, providing end-to-end system validation.  
-  Employed modern Java practices (Java 21), robust validation utilities, and asynchronous processing to ensure reliability and scalability of the trading system on Mac environments.  
-  Configured Gradle wrapper and project for seamless builds and IDE integration (IntelliJ IDEA), ensuring portability and maintainability across development and production environments.
