Order Matching Engine Like Stock Exchange 


- Developed a modular plagiarism detection system in Java using advanced data structures and algorithms, including Trie, Suffix Array, Hashing, and Dynamic Programming (Levenshtein edit distance).
- Engineered multi-method code similarity analysis by integrating string matching algorithms (KMP, Rabin-Karp) and N-gram Jaccard similarity, achieving comprehensive detection of both exact and paraphrased code similarities.
- Designed a scalable and extensible architecture with clear separation of logic for file I/O, algorithmic analysis, and result aggregation, ensuring maintainability and easy feature extension.
- Demonstrated expertise in applied algorithmics and data structure optimization, enabling efficient processing of large codebases and robust code plagiarism detection.
